ðŸ’¾ Database
Default DB

SQLite file: instance/business.db

Auto-created on first run.

Backup

From the Settings â†’ Backup page you can click Backup Database.

This copies business.db into a timestamped file in backups/.

Example:

backups/business_backup_2025-09-12_16-30-00.db

Restore

To restore a backup:

Stop the app (Docker container or local run).

Copy the backup file back into instance/:

cp backups/business_backup_2025-09-12_16-30-00.db instance/business.db


Restart the app.
Your data will now be restored.

ðŸ“‘ Invoices

Generated directly from a bookingâ€™s work orders.

Stored in DB (Invoice + InvoiceItems).

Can be exported as PDF (/invoices/<id>/pdf).

Deleting an invoice will also delete its line items (cascade delete).

ðŸ›  Development Notes

Models: SQLAlchemy

Templates: Jinja2 + Bootstrap

PDF generation: ReportLab

Backups: shutil.copy with timestamp

ðŸ”’ Security Notes

Default secret key is "dev-secret-key".
For production, set:

export SECRET_KEY="your-super-secret-key"


SQLite is fine for small-scale usage. For production, consider Postgres or MySQL.
